STEPS TO RUN APP LOCALLY

1) Open CRUDAPP folder, and run 'npm install' using bash. the command
should install packages required for the app to run.

2) Open the CRUDWEBAPI folder, open the .sln project using Visual studio
and run the API. 

3) after installing packages and CRUDWEBAPI project is running, go back to CRUDWEBAPI folder
and run the app using bash. run 'ng serve'

NOTE: my database is being served on azure, you can change connection string from the appsettings.json file,
i also included a SQL script to create the database used for the app.

Thanks!!
